# Human-emotion-Detection



This repository contains the implementation of a human emotion detection system using OpenCV, a popular computer vision library. The project aims to identify human emotions from facial expressions captured through a webcam or an image.

## Features
- **Real-Time Emotion Detection**: Detect emotions from a live webcam feed.
- **Image Emotion Detection**: Detect emotions from static images.
- **Emotion Categories**: The system can classify emotions such as happy, sad, angry, surprised, and neutral.
- **Pre-trained Models**: Uses pre-trained models for facial detection and emotion classification.

## Installation
### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- TensorFlow/Keras
- NumPy

### Setup
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/human-emotion-detection.git
   cd human-emotion-detection
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv env
   source env/bin/activate  # On Windows use `env\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Download the pre-trained models and place them in the `models/` directory.

## Usage
1. **Real-Time Detection**:
   ```bash
   python real_time_detection.py
   ```
   This will start the webcam and display the real-time emotion detection.

2. **Image Detection**:
   ```bash
   python image_detection.py --image path/to/image.jpg
   ```
   This will process the given image and display the detected emotion.

## Dataset
The project uses a publicly available facial emotion recognition dataset. For example, the [FER-2013 dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/challenges-in-representation-learning-facial-expression-recognition-challenge/data) can be used for training and evaluation.

## Model Training
To train the emotion detection model, follow these steps:
1. Preprocess the dataset and split it into training and validation sets.
2. Train the model using the script:
   ```bash
   python train_model.py --dataset path/to/dataset
   ```
3. The trained model will be saved in the `models/` directory.
